# Overview

## What is the Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit?
The Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit (CPTC) is a refundable corporate tax credit designed to encourage the
creation of Canadian film and television programming and the development of an active domestic independent production
sector in Canada.
The CPTC program is jointly administered by the Department of Canadian Heritage, through the Canadian
Audio-Visual Certification Office (CAVCO), and by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
The CPTC is governed by section 125.4 of the *Income Tax Act* (the "Act") and section 1106 of the *Income Tax Regulations* (the
"Regulations").
Links to the full text of the Act and Regulations are available on CAVCO's website¹.
The Act and Regulations take
precedence, to the extent of any inconsistency with these guidelines.

## What information is in these guidelines?
These guidelines focus on the requirements a production must meet to be certified as a Canadian film or video production
under the CPTC program.
They also explain how the tax credit for a production is calculated, and the CRA's role in reviewing claims for the tax credit
following the certification of a production through CAVCO.
## Who can apply for the CPTC?

The CPTC is available only to a Canadian production company that is a qualified corporation.
A qualified corporation is one that
is throughout a given taxation year a prescribed taxable Canadian corporation with a permanent establishment in Canada, and
that primarily carries on the activities of a Canadian film or video production business.
A Canadian film or video production in
this context is a production meeting the requirements of section 1106 of the Regulations.
## How do I submit an application to CAVCO?

Applications for CPTC certification must be submitted through the CAVCO Online application system.
See CAVCO's website for
more information.

Production companies must apply to CAVCO for both a Canadian film or video production certificate (Part A certificate) and a
certificate of completion (Part B certificate) for each production.
## How is the CPTC calculated?

The CPTC is available at the rate of 25% of the qualified labour expenditure for an eligible production in a given taxation year.
The qualified labour expenditure represents the eligible labour expenses incurred for a production, capped at 60% of the
production's total cost once funding amounts considered assistance are deducted.
The maximum CPTC available for a
production is therefore 15% of the total cost of production net of assistance.
The rules for calculating the tax credit are set out
in section 125.4 of the Act.
## Are all types of audiovisual content eligible for the CPTC?
To be eligible for CPTC certification, a production must be a linear, non-interactive film or video production.
An interactive project requiring some form of viewer intervention to progress the storyline is not eligible.
A 360/virtual reality
(VR) production can be eligible, as long as the storyline progresses in a linear way without needing any active viewer
intervention.
Viewer involvement outside of the context of the audiovisual project-for example, through online voting - is
acceptable.
Websites, games, apps, and any similar products are not eligible for the CPTC.
<sup>1</sup> Note that when extended parts of Acts or Regulations are directly quoted in these guidelines, they appear in italics.

## What is the Film or Video Production Services Tax Credit (PSTC)?
The PSTC is the other federal audiovisual tax credit program co-administered by CAVCO and the CRA.
It promotes Canada as a
location of choice for foreign- and Canadian-owned film and television productions and supports the existence of a production
infrastructure of international calibre in Canada.
It is available to Canadian-based production companies or production service companies at a rate of 16% of the qualified
Canadian labour expenditure for a production.
The qualified Canadian labour expenditure is equal to all eligible labour expenses
(expenses payable to Canadian residents for services rendered in Canada) minus the total of all financing amounts considered
assistance.
Productions eligible for the PSTC generally feature non-Canadian creative control and non-Canadian copyright ownership.
For more information on PSTC program requirements, see CAVCO's website.
Note that a corporation cannot receive both the PSTC and the CPTC for the same production.
## What are the requirements for a production to be eligible for the CPTC?
For a production to be eligible under the CPTC program, it must meet all of the requirements set out below.
Each is further
described in the noted section of the guidelines.
These requirements are found in section 125.4 of the Act and section 1106 of
the Regulations, under the definitions for "Canadian film or video production," "Canadian film or video production certificate"
and "excluded production."
1) **Application and certification deadlines**

   CAVCO has a two-part application process.
There is no deadline to submit a Part A application for a production.
A Part B
application must be received by CAVCO within 24 months of the production company's first taxation year end following
the start of principal photography.
The Part B certificate for a production must be issued by CAVCO within six months of
this application deadline.
These deadlines can be extended by 18 months if valid T2029 waivers are filed with the CRA.
(See
section 1.09)

2) **Canadian production company**

   The production company must be a prescribed taxable Canadian corporation and a qualified corporation.
(See sections
2.01-2.02)

3) **Canadian copyright ownership**

   Only the production company or a prescribed person may own copyright in the production during the 25-year period
beginning when the production is complete and commercially exploitable.
(See sections 3.01-3.03)

4) **Production genres**

   The production cannot fall under any of the ineligible production genres.
(See sections 4.01-4.03)

5) **Key creative points for Canadians**

   The production must obtain a minimum number of points given for key creative positions occupied by Canadian citizens or
permanent residents, and obtain certain points that are mandatory.
(See sections 6.01-6.08)

6) **Canadian producer**

   All producer-related personnel (other than those receiving exemptions permitted in limited circumstances) must be
Canadian.
(See sections 6.09-6.13)

7) **Canadian cost requirements**

   At least 75% of the total of all costs for services related to producing the production (other than certain excluded costs)
must be payable for services provided to or by individuals who are Canadian.
(See section 7.10)

   At least 75% of the total of all post-production costs for a production (other than certain excluded costs) must be incurred
for services provided in Canada.
(See section 7.10)

7

--- PAGE 8 ---

8) **Canadian control over exploitation rights**

   Only the production company or a prescribed person may control the initial licensing of commercial exploitation rights for
the production.
(See section 8.01)

9) **Exploitation in Canada**

   Either a Canadian distributor or a CRTC-licensed broadcaster must provide written confirmation that the production will be
shown in Canada within the two-year period beginning when the production is complete and commercially exploitable.
(See sections 8.02-8.06)

10) **No distribution in Canada by non-Canadians**

    The production cannot be distributed in Canada by a non-Canadian entity within the two-year period beginning when the
production is complete and commercially exploitable.
(See section 8.08)

11) **Acceptable share of revenues**

    The production company or a related prescribed taxable Canadian corporation must receive an acceptable share of
revenues from the exploitation of the production in non-Canadian markets.
(See section 8.09)

Note that requirements 3, 5-8 and 11 do not apply to treaty coproductions.
A treaty coproduction must meet all other requirements, and must conform to the terms of the applicable coproduction treaty.
See Chapter 5 for more information on the certification of treaty coproductions under the CPTC program.

## 1.02 Overview

On behalf of the Minister of Canadian Heritage, CAVCO
issues certificates for productions meeting all certification
requirements under the CPTC program.
(See section 1.03)

Production companies submit these certificates to the
Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), as part of their T2
Corporation Income Tax Returns, to receive the tax credit.
(See section 1.04)

## 1.03 Role of CAVCO

### 1.03.01 General

CAVCO is responsible for assessing whether a production
meets the requirements for CPTC certification set out in
section 125.4 of the Act and section 1106 of the
Regulations.
CAVCO then recommends to the Minister of
Canadian Heritage whether or not to issue a "Canadian
film or video production certificate" (a "Part A certificate")
for the production.<sup>2</sup>

Once a production is completed, CAVCO is responsible for
assessing whether the production continues to meet the
requirements of the Act and Regulations.
CAVCO
recommends to the Minister whether or not to issue a
"certificate of completion" (a "Part B certificate") for the
production.
A production for which a certificate of
completion is not issued loses its status as a Canadian film
or video production.
More information on each certificate
can be found in sections 1.03.02 and 1.03.03.
A previously issued Part A certificate may be revoked by
the Minister of Canadian Heritage if an omission or
incorrect statement was made for the purpose of
obtaining the certificate, or where, for any reason, the
production is found not to be a Canadian film or video
production.
A revoked certificate is deemed never to have
been issued. See section 1.11 for more information on
revocations.
### 1.03.02 Canadian film or video production certificate (Part A certificate)

This certificate confirms that a production is a "Canadian
film or video production."
The certificate also provides estimates of the production
costs and labour expenditures associated with a
production, as well as the tax credit applicable to the
production.
These estimates are based on an analysis of
budget and financing information for the production.
The Part A certificate is generally issued before or during
production, to help production companies secure other
production financing and to allow them to claim a tax
credit at the end of the first year of production.
Note that
it is not necessary for a production company to have
received both the Part A and Part B certificates before
applying for the tax credit with the CRA.
A claim can be
filed with just the Part A certificate.
If CAVCO cannot conclusively determine whether one or
more types of financing for a production are assistance
(see section 7.06), this financing will be treated as
assistance for the purpose of CAVCO's estimate of the tax
credit for the production.
The estimate provided by CAVCO is not binding on the
CRA, and is not a commitment as to the final value of the
tax credit.
A final determination of the qualified labour
expenditure and tax credit for a production is made by the
CRA during its review of a tax credit claim for a given year.
### 1.03.03 Certificate of completion (Part B certificate)

A Part B certificate is issued where a production is
completed and continues to meet the requirements for
being certified under the CPTC program.
If this certificate
is not issued within the prescribed time frame (see section
1.09), the CRA will refuse any tax credit claim for the

<sup>2</sup> The Director General, Audiovisual Branch in the Department of Canadian Heritage has been delegated the authority to certify productions on
behalf of the Minister..

--- PAGE 10 ---

production and reassess the corporation's tax returns for
any tax credit previously allowed.<sup>3</sup>

An applicant may apply at the same time (with a "Part A/B
application") for both the Canadian film or video
production certificate and the certificate of completion,
once a production is completed.
### 1.03.04 Certification of episodes in a series

For the purpose of CPTC certification, each episode in a
series or mini-series, or film in an anthology of short films,
is considered a distinct production.
If an application to
CAVCO is for a series, only one certificate is issued, with
the suffix of the certificate number indicating the total
number of eligible episodes.
For example, 45678-010
means that 10 episodes have been certified.

## 1.04 Role of the CRA

### 1.04.01 General

The CRA is responsible for:

- applying the sections of the Act relevant for
determining the CPTC (this includes confirming the
qualified labour expenditure amount, calculating the
tax credit amount, and confirming that a corporation
is a qualified corporation);
- reviewing and auditing CPTC claims within a
reasonable time frame;

- assessing the company's T2 Corporation income tax
return;
and

- issuing timely refund cheques where applicable.

To claim the tax credit for a certified production, a
qualified corporation must file with its T2 Corporation
Income Tax Return:

a) the Part A certificate issued for the production;
and

b) a CRA T1131 "Canadian Film or Video Production Tax
Credit" form.
CAVCO informs the CRA if, for any reason, a Part B
certificate is not subsequently issued for the production.
As previously noted, the CRA will in these cases refuse any
new tax credit claim for the production and reassess the
corporation's tax returns for any tax credit previously
allowed.
The CPTC is a refundable tax credit. This means that the
qualified corporation will be refunded the amount of the
tax credit, to the extent that it exceeds the total of any tax
payable for the year, and subject to the CRA's right to
offset any other amount the corporation owes.
Note that under subsection 164(1) of the Act, a tax credit
for a given taxation year can only be issued in the form of
a refund if the T2 Corporation Income Tax Return for that
year was filed within three years of the end of that year.
As part of its review of a tax credit claim, the CRA may
request any additional information it deems necessary,
including in the course of a full fiscal audit of the
production.
This may include, but is not limited to, the
books and records of the corporation and the full
applications filed with CAVCO.
More information on the CRA's role in co-administering
the CPTC program, as well as its Form T1131 and its
publication *Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit -
Guide to Form T1131*, can be found on its website.
### 1.04.02 Claiming a capital cost allowance for a CPTC-certified production

A CPTC-certified production is a Class 10(x) property under
Schedule II of the Regulations, and is eligible for an
accelerated Capital Cost Allowance (CCA).
For more
information, see the CRA website or contact the applicable
regional CRA Film Services Unit.
## 1.05 Certification of Treaty Coproductions under the CPTC Program

Treaty coproductions involving a Canadian production
company can be eligible for the CPTC.
For a treaty coproduction to be considered a Canadian film
or video production, the Canadian production company
coproducing it must apply to Telefilm Canada (Telefilm) for
Preliminary and Final Recommendations, as well as to
CAVCO for a Part A certificate and a Part B certificate.
Telefilm is the administrative authority responsible for
evaluating whether a production meets the criteria set out
in the relevant coproduction treaty.
It provides CAVCO

<sup>3</sup> This would occur after the CRA has received notice from CAVCO that a previously issued Part A certificate is being revoked, or, in the case of
combined Part A and B applications, that the applications are being denied.
<sup>4</sup> Subsequent references in these guidelines to "series" will be deemed to include "mini-series" and "anthology".
"Episode" will be deemed to
include a film in the case of an anthology of short films.

10

--- PAGE 11 ---

11
with both a Preliminary Recommendation and a Final
Recommendation as to whether a production meets treaty
requirements.
CAVCO makes a recommendation to the Minister of
Canadian Heritage as to whether or not the coproduction
should be certified under the CPTC program.
See Chapter 5 for more information on treaty
coproductions.
## 1.06 Submitting an Application to CAVCO
### 1.06.01 Complete application
Applicants are responsible for submitting complete CPTC
applications to CAVCO.
Production companies must file complete applications
through the CAVCO Online application system, accessible
through CAVCO's website.
Supporting documentation must be included as part of a
complete Part A or Part B application to CAVCO.
A list of
this documentation can be found in the “How to apply”
section of the CPTC page on CAVCO's website.
Note that
CAVCO does not accept redacted documents.
Incomplete applications will not proceed for analysis with
a tax credit officer unless all required information and
documents are received.
If information or documentation required to determine
the eligibility of a production is not provided to CAVCO
upon request, CAVCO could recommend the file for denial
or revocation at any time.
For more information on the
process for denial or revocations, see section 1.11.
### 1.06.02 Requests for additional information
CAVCO reserves the right to request any additional
information, affidavits or sworn statements necessary to
ensure that a CPTC certificate should be issued for a
production.
CAVCO may also ask the production company to provide
any necessary records or financial documents for auditing
purposes.
The production company must ensure that
adequate space and time are provided, and that all
relevant documents are made available, for an audit.
While a copy of a production (three representative
episodes for a series) is always required at the Part B
application stage, CAVCO may also request a copy at the
Part A stage (a rough cut is acceptable) where necessary.
This may occur, for example, where there is a potential
concern related to the production meeting genre or lead
performer eligibility requirements.
Where a copy of the production is requested at the Part A
stage, note that a final copy of the production is still
required with the Part B application for the production.
CAVCO also reserves the right to request more episodes of
a series at any stage of analysis.
This may occur, for
example, where there is a concern with the eligibility of
one or more of the episodes submitted originally.
In rare
cases, CAVCO may ask to see all episodes in a series.
## 1.07 Application Fees
A fee is required for each application to CAVCO.
The fee amount for an application may be adjusted by
CAVCO prior to certification, where a change to the
production budget or production financing affects the
eligible production cost.
In the event this results in an
additional fee being owed by the applicant, the
outstanding amount must be paid before the certificate is
issued.
Overpayments will be refunded after Part B
certification for the production.
More information on application fees is available on
CAVCO’s website.
## 1.08 Application Review Process
When an application is received by CAVCO, it is reviewed
for completeness.
Once an application is complete, it is
placed in a queue to be assigned to a tax credit officer.
When the application is assigned to a tax credit offer, they
will review it and contact the production company if
additional information or clarification is needed.
Once the tax credit officer’s review is complete, the file is
advanced for further approvals, ending with a final
recommendation being made to the Director General,
Audiovisual Branch to either certify the production, or
deny or revoke the certification of the production, on
behalf of the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
The applicant
is notified as soon as possible of the decision.
Notifications from CAVCO are sent to the applicant’s
Message Centre in the CAVCO Online system.
It is
therefore important for the applicant to check their
messages on a regular basis.
Applicants should also ensure
that all contact information for their applications
(including e-mail address, phone number and mailing
address) is kept up to date.
See Figure 1 for more details on CAVCO’s application
review process. For information on CAVCO’s service

standards and current processing times, see CAVCO’s
website.

The four boxes on the left side of the diagram represent the
different file status messages that an applicant sees in the
CAVCO Online system.

the CAVCO Performance Results webpage.
** Officers may request missing information or additional
clarification for a file, in which case applicants will see the
status message “In progress – not submitted” or
“amendment in progress – not submitted”.
The application
does not progress to the next stage of analysis until all
required information is received.

## 1.09 Part B Application and Certification Deadlines
### 1.09.01 Overview
While there is no deadline for applying to CAVCO for a Part
A certificate for a production, there are deadlines for
applying for a Part B certificate, and for this certificate
being issued by CAVCO to the applicant.
### 1.09.02 Part B application deadline/ CRA waiver requirements
The initial Part B application deadline is 24 months from
the end of the corporation’s taxation year in which the
production’s principal photography began (the “24-month
deadline”).<sup>5</sup>

This deadline can be extended to 42 months from the first
taxation year end date (the “42-month deadline”), as long
as the applicant files valid T2029 waivers with the CRA for
both the first and second taxation years ending after
principal photography began.
CAVCO verifies directly with
the CRA that valid waivers, when required, have been
filed.
See CAVCO’s website for more information on how
to fill out and file these waivers, and to view a sample
waiver.
For clarity purposes:
- The Part B application must be filed with CAVCO by the 42-month deadline.
- The two properly completed waivers for the
production must be filed with the CRA by the 42-
month deadline, and within the normal reassessment
period for the two taxation years.
A waiver should not
be filed for a taxation year if that year has not yet
been assessed by the CRA.
- If a waiver is not completed correctly or is submitted
when the relevant taxation year has not yet been
assessed, the form will be returned to the claimant,
causing potential delays with CPTC certification.
The normal reassessment period for a taxation year is
three years from the date of the mailing of the notice of
assessment for Canadian-controlled private corporations,
and four years from this date for public corporations.
A failure to meet the final 42-month deadline, or to file
valid waivers when required, will result in a previously
issued Part A certificate being revoked, or a Part A/B
application being denied.
<sup>5</sup> On rare occasions, principal photography for a production may have begun before a production company was incorporated.
For greater
certainty, the first taxation year end will be the first one following incorporation of the company.
### 1.09.03 Part B application deadline for domestic coproductions
When two or more Canadian production companies enter
into a domestic coproduction arrangement (see section
2.03), the deadlines for applying to the CPTC are
determined using the taxation year end of the primary
applicant.
If the primary applicant is submitting a Part B
application after the 24-month deadline, the coproducing
partner will also have to file waivers with the CRA.
### 1.09.04 Part B certification deadline
A Part B certificate must be issued within 6 months of a
production’s application deadline.
The 48-month deadline
is therefore the final date by which CAVCO must issue a
Part B certificate for a production.
An applicant must submit a complete application and
respond to all requests for information or clarification
from CAVCO in a timely manner, so that CAVCO’s analysis
can be completed, and a certificate issued, by this final
deadline.
If no Part B certificate is issued by the 48-month deadline,
a previously issued Part A certificate will be revoked, or a
Part A/B application will be denied.

| 48-month Part B certification deadline                    | December 31, 2019 |

In this example (see table above), if the Part B application
is being submitted after the 24-month deadline:
- The Part B application must be submitted to CAVCO by June 30, 2019;
and
- Valid CRA T2029 waivers, for each of the taxation years ending December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, would need to be filed with the CRA within the

--- PAGE 14 ---

14
normal reassessment period for each of those two
years.
### 1.09.06 Ensuring that the taxation year end date is correct
The applicant is responsible for ensuring that all Part B
deadlines are met.
As a courtesy to applicants, CAVCO
does issue reminder notices of Part B application deadlines
at the 22-month, 24-month, 40-month, and 41month
marks based on dates submitted in the Part A application.
When the taxation year end provided by the applicant
with a Part A application is incorrect, or is later changed<sup>6</sup>
without CAVCO being informed, CAVCO reminder notices
may also be incorrect.
Note that once the first taxation year end has been
confirmed through a company’s first filing of a T2 return
for that year, Part B deadlines will continue to be
calculated by reference to this date, even if the company
later changes its taxation year.
## 1.10 Compliance Reviews
If CAVCO determines that a production may not be eligible
under the CPTC program, the file is submitted to CAVCO’s
Compliance Committee for review of the issue(s) of
ineligibility.
Based on this review, additional information or
clarification may be requested from the applicant, or the
file may be recommended for denial (for a Part A or Part
A/B application) or revocation (for a Part B application).
For more information on the process for denials or
revocations, see section 1.11.
<sup>6</sup> CAVCO recognizes that a tentative taxation year end date listed in a Part A application may change by the time the production company first
files a T2 Corporation Income Tax return with the CRA.
## 1.11 Denials and Revocations
If an application is for a Part A certificate, or for both Part
A and Part B certificates at the same time, and the
production does not meet the requirements for CPTC
certification, the production will be denied certification.
Where a Part A certificate has already been issued for a
production, it may be revoked by the Minister of Canadian
Heritage where:
a) an omission or incorrect statement was made for the purpose of obtaining the certificate;
or
b) the production is not a Canadian film or video production.
Where a review of an application reveals an issue of
ineligibility, CAVCO sends the applicant an advance notice
detailing the reasons why the production appears to be
ineligible.
The applicant is provided the opportunity to
submit additional information that may impact the final
evaluation of the application.
If, after considering the additional information, CAVCO
makes a final recommendation that the production not be
certified, or if the applicant fails to provide a response
within the allotted time frame, the applicant is sent a final
notification of denial or revocation issued by the Director
General, Audiovisual Branch, on behalf of the Minister.
A certificate that is revoked is deemed never to have been
issued.
CAVCO provides a copy of the final notice to the
CRA for all denials and revocations.
Applicants may apply to the Federal Court for judicial
review of a final decision within 30 days of being notified
by CAVCO of the decision.
To apply for judicial review, an
applicant must send a completed Form 301, Notice of
Application (Federal Court website), with the appropriate
filing fee, to the registrar of the Federal Court.
For more
information on how to file an application for judicial
review, or other general enquiries, visit the Courts
Administration Services website.
## 1.12 Internal CAVCO Audits
Each year, CAVCO performs a more in-depth review of a
select number of applications.
CAVCO reserves the right to
request any additional information necessary for a
complete audit of the application.
**Additional extension to Part B application deadline due to COVID-19**
Due to the effect of COVID-19 on the Canadian
audiovisual sector, the Department of Finance Canada
has introduced temporary extensions to various
timelines applicable to the CPTC.
Applicants who incurred labour expenses for a
production during their taxation year ending in 2020 or
2021 may be eligible for an additional extension to their
Part B application and certification deadlines for the
production.
See CAVCO Public Notice 2022-03 for more information.

## 1.13 Preliminary Opinions of Eligibility (Pre-assessments)
A production company may ask CAVCO to provide a
preliminary opinion on the eligibility of a production for
CPTC certification with respect to a specific issue.
This
opinion is based strictly on the information made available
at the time to CAVCO, and is not binding on whether or
not the production will ultimately be eligible, including
with respect to the specific issue identified in the pre-assessment request.
Full Part A and B applications for a
production must ultimately be received for CAVCO to
provide a final recommendation to the Minister of
Canadian Heritage regarding the production’s eligibility.
A request for a pre-assessment may be submitted to
CAVCO only if a CPTC application for the production has
not yet been submitted, and if the production has been
substantially developed.
Requests for pre-assessments can be sent to CAVCO’s
Compliance Committee at bcpacc-cavcoc@pch.gc.ca.
All pre-assessment requests must include:
- the name of the production company (or parent company if a production company has not yet been incorporated);
- the title of the production and, where applicable, the number and length of episodes;
- the broadcaster or distributor involved or being contemplated; and
- the specific eligibility issue to be addressed (e.g., a question about lead performer, genre, etc.).
If no specific eligibility concerns are identified and
explained, CAVCO will not be able to proceed with a pre-assessment.
If the concern relates to whether a production falls under
an ineligible genre category, the request must include, in
addition to the specific genre(s) of concern:
- a detailed treatment and/or series bible (note that a one-page synopsis or concept is not sufficient);
- for series, a sample episodic breakdown providing the details and length of each segment in the episode, to show what each segment will look like once produced;
and
- if available, a copy of the completed production or, for a format production, a copy of the original version of the production it is based on.
CAVCO’s pre-assessment letter must be attached to any
future CPTC application made to CAVCO for the
production.
## 1.14 Confidentiality of Taxpayer Information
### 1.14.01 General
All information provided by an applicant under the CPTC
program is subject to the taxpayer confidentiality
provisions in section 241 of the *Income Tax Act*.
This
section restricts how government officials can use or
communicate information obtained for the purpose of
administering the Act.
The full text of section 241 can be
found on the Department of Justice website.
### 1.14.02 Publication of titles of certified productions
Subsection 241(3.3) of the Act allows the communication
of limited information regarding productions that have
been Part A certified under the CPTC program.
Accordingly, CAVCO publishes a list of titles and associated
production companies for all Part A certified productions.
A link to the list is available on CAVCO’s website.
### 1.14.03 Sharing information with other federal or provincial government entities
Under section 241 of the Act, CAVCO can share
information with:
a) other entities directly involved with the co-administration of the CPTC, including the CRA and, in the context of treaty coproductions, Telefilm Canada;
b) any federal or provincial government office or agency whose mandate includes the provision of assistance for film or video productions, to the extent that the information is shared for the purpose of administering or enforcing of the program under which the assistance is offered;
or
c) the CRTC, to the extent that it is being provided for the purpose of the administration or enforcement of a regulatory function of the CRTC.
## 1.15 Screen Credit Requirements
The Canadian production company, as well as the
individual(s) occupying the producer position, must be
clearly identified and given prominence on screen in the
main titles, and in all billing blocks.

--- PAGE 16 ---

16
The Canadian copyright notice must also appear in the tail-end screen credits.
The “Canada” wordmark logo, accompanied by the
wording “Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit,”
must appear on all domestic and international versions of
each certified production, and in all related advertising,
publicity and promotional materials.
More information can
be found on CAVCO’s website.
## 1.16 Canadian Content Certification through the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)
The CRTC has a Canadian content certification program
that is similar in many respects to the CPTC certification
process.
However, no tax credit is provided through the
CRTC.
For the purpose of CRTC program logs, broadcasters can
submit a CPTC certificate number for a production, in lieu
of the certification (“C”) number issued through the CRTC’s
Canadian Program Certification section.
For more information, visit the CRTC’s website.

# 2. Corporate Eligibility Requirements
## 2.01 Prescribed Taxable Canadian Corporation
### 2.01.01 Overview
The production company producing a film or video
production and applying for CPTC certification must
demonstrate that it is a “prescribed taxable Canadian
corporation,” as defined in the Regulations.
This means the corporation must be a taxable Canadian
corporation<sup>7</sup> that is:
a) Canadian-controlled, based on sections 26 to 28 of the *Investment Canada Act*;
b) not controlled directly or indirectly in any manner by one or more persons, all or part of whose taxable income is exempt from tax under Part I of the *Income Tax Act* (for example, tax-exempt non-profit corporations, charitable organizations, etc.);
and
c) not a prescribed labour-sponsored venture capital corporation, as defined in section 6701 of the Regulations.
For the purpose of sections 26 to 28 of the *Investment Canada Act*, “Canadian” means:
(a) a Canadian citizen;
(b) a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act* who has been ordinarily resident in Canada<sup>8</sup> for not more than one year after the time at which he or she first became eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship;<sup>9</sup>
(c) a Canadian government, whether federal, provincial or local, or an agency thereof;
or
(d) an entity that is Canadian-controlled, as determined under subsection 26(1) or (2) and in respect of which
<sup>7</sup> The production company must be incorporated in Canada.
For information on federal incorporation, visit the website of the Corporations Canada division of Innovation, Science and Economic Development.
For provincial or territorial incorporation, contact the appropriate government ministry.
<sup>8</sup> This means that individuals have taken residence in Canada in their usual day-to-day routine.
<sup>9</sup> This interpretation of permanent resident applies only in the context of assessing Canadian control of a corporation.
For other purposes such as the evaluation of producer-related or key creative positions, an individual who has been a permanent resident for any length of time is considered Canadian.
there has been no determination made under any of subsections 26(2.1), (2.11) and (2.31), or declaration made under subsection 26(2.2) or (2.32).
### 2.01.02 How CAVCO assesses control of a corporation
For a production company to meet the Canadian
ownership and control requirements of the CPTC program,
there must be control in law (“de jure” control) of the
company by Canadians, with respect to shareholders’
voting rights.
It must also be clear that this extends to
control in fact (“de facto” control), having regard for the
nature of shareholders’, officers’ or directors’ involvement
with, or influence within, the company.
In other words, de
facto control may exist when another corporation, person
or group of persons has any direct or indirect influence
that, if exercised, would result in control in fact of the
corporation.
The assessment of a company’s eligibility is based
primarily on information provided by the applicant in the
“Shareholders” section of an application.
CAVCO may in some cases request additional information
to confirm the control of a corporation based on the
rights, privileges and decision-making authority of
shareholders (e.g., through articles of incorporation,
shareholder agreements, trust agreements, legal opinions,
organization charts or similar documentation).
CAVCO may request additional supporting documents for
a publicly traded company, such as the company’s articles
of incorporation, its notice of registered office, or a
certified list of shareholders.
Additional documents may
also be required if a shareholder is an entity such as a sole
proprietorship, a partnership or a trust.
Any corporate shareholder (or a shareholder such as a
partnership or a trust) owning a majority of voting shares
in the production company must also be shown to be
Canadian-controlled.
Where there are several minority shareholders that are
corporations or other business entities, it must be shown
that a majority of shares are owned by Canadian-controlled entities.

--- PAGE 18 ---

18
## 2.02 Qualified Corporation
A company applying for the tax credit under the CPTC
program must be a “qualified corporation,” as defined in
the Act.
Under this definition, a corporation must be one that is,
throughout a given taxation year, a prescribed taxable
Canadian corporation (see section 2.01) whose activities
consist primarily of carrying on a Canadian film or video
production business, through a permanent establishment
in Canada.
Where the business of a corporation consists primarily of
other activities such as the rental of equipment or studios,
the distribution of audiovisual productions, or the
production of films or videos that are not Canadian film or
video productions, the corporation is not considered a
qualified corporation.
If a corporation engages in more than one business, the
assessment of its primary activity is based on evaluating
factors such as the revenues generated by each business,
the capital employed in each business, and the time spent
by employees, agents or officers on each business.
The CRA determines whether a production company is a
qualified corporation.
If a production company is unsure
whether or not it is a qualified corporation for tax credit
purposes, it may contact its regional Film Services Unit of
the CRA prior to submitting an application to CAVCO.
## 2.03 Domestic Coproductions
A domestic coproduction is a production for which more
than one Canadian production company incurs expenses.
Only one application for certification is submitted to
CAVCO through the company designated by the
coproducers as the primary applicant for the application.
However, information on all coproducing companies must
be included with the application.
Each production
company must be a prescribed taxable Canadian
corporation and a qualified corporation.
For domestic coproductions, CAVCO issues only one CPTC
certificate. Each production company may then claim their
own portion of the tax credit with the CRA.
Note that where two or more partnering Canadian
production companies incorporate a subsidiary company
to be the sole production company for a production, the
production should not be identified as a domestic
coproduction in an application to CAVCO.

--- PAGE 19 ---

19
# 3. Copyright Ownership
## 3.01 General
Unless a production is a treaty coproduction, only the
Canadian production company or a “prescribed person”
can be a copyright owner of the production for all
commercial exploitation purposes, for the 25-year period
beginning when the production is completed and
commercially exploitable.
No other person or entity can place any restriction on the
ability of the production company or prescribed person to
exercise full copyright ownership rights in the production
during this period.
This is verified by CAVCO through its
review of documents such as exploitation, financing and
chain-of-title agreements.
## 3.02 Copyright Owner
Under the Regulations, a “copyright owner” for the
purpose of the CPTC can be:
(a) the maker, as defined in section 2 of the *Copyright Act*, who at that time owns copyright in relation to the production, within the meaning of section 3 of that Act;
or
(b) a person to whom that copyright has been assigned, under an assignment described in section 13 of the *Copyright Act*, either wholly or partially, by the maker or by another owner to whom this paragraph applied before the assignment.
For greater certainty, the granting of an exclusive licence
within the meaning of the *Copyright Act* (for example, to a
broadcaster or a distributor) is not an assignment of
copyright.
## 3.03 Prescribed Person
### 3.03.01 Overview
In the Regulations, a “prescribed person” is defined as:
(a) a corporation that holds a television, specialty or pay-television broadcasting licence issued by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission;
(b) a corporation that holds a broadcast undertaking licence and that provides production funding as a
<sup>10</sup> This would generally include non-profit organizations.
<sup>11</sup> This would generally include registered charities.
<sup>12</sup> This does not apply if the corporation also falls under another part of the “prescribed person” definition.
For example, the form is not
required if a corporation is also a Canadian broadcaster.
result of a “significant benefits” commitment given to the [CRTC];
(c) a person to which paragraph 149(1)(l) of the Act applies<sup>10</sup> and that has a fund that is used to finance Canadian film or video productions;
(d) a Canadian government film agency,
(e) in respect of a film or video production, a non-resident person that does not carry on a business in Canada through a permanent establishment in Canada and whose interest (or, for civil law, right) in the production is acquired to comply with the certification requirements of a treaty coproduction twinning arrangement;
and
(f) a person
  (i) to which paragraph 149(1)(f) of the Act applies<sup>11</sup>,
  (ii) that has a fund that is used to finance Canadian film or video productions, all or substantially all of which financing is provided by way of a direct ownership interest (or, for civil law, right) in those productions, and
  (iii) that, after 1996, has received donations only from persons described in paragraphs (a) to (e).
(g) a prescribed taxable Canadian corporation;
(h) an individual who is a Canadian;
and
(i) a partnership, each member of which is described in any of paragraphs (a) to (h).
Note that if an entity other than the Canadian production
company is a copyright owner of a production, this may
have an impact on how a Capital Cost Allowance for the
production is claimed.
Production companies may consult
with their regional CRA Film Services Unit office for further
information on this issue.
### 3.03.02 Documentation demonstrating that an individual or entity is a “prescribed person”
a) A prescribed taxable Canadian corporation must provide a “Private Company Declaration” (available on CAVCO’s website) completed and signed by an authorized representative of the corporation.<sup>12</sup>

--- PAGE 20 ---

20
b) Individuals that are prescribed persons must demonstrate that they are Canadian citizens or permanent residents by either:
  (i) providing a completed and signed “Individual Declaration – Prescribed Person” (available on CAVCO’s website);
or
  (ii) providing a CAVCO Personnel Number (see section 6.01.03).
For other entities acting as prescribed persons, CAVCO will
ask the applicant to provide documentation where
necessary.
### 3.03.03 Involvement of an individual or entity that is not a prescribed person
A non-prescribed person may make an investment in a
production or participate in profits generated from a
production, but cannot be a copyright owner of the
production, or have any control over the initial licensing of
commercial exploitation rights for the production.
Note that in cases where a non-prescribed person invests
in a production without being a copyright owner, CAVCO
examines relevant agreements to ensure that their
involvement does not raise any concerns related to:
a) production control (see section 6.10) or
b) the retention by the production company of an acceptable share of revenues (see section 8.09).

# 4. Ineligible Production Genres
## 4.01 List of Ineligible Genres
There is not a list of production genres that are eligible
under the CPTC program.
Instead, the Regulations outline
ten genres (listed below) that are not eligible for the
program.
Additional clarifications on how CAVCO assesses
ineligible genres, including relevant definitions, can be
found in section 4.03.
a) news, current events or public affairs programming, or a program that includes weather or market reports;
b) a production in respect of a game, questionnaire or contest (other than a production directed primarily at minors);
c) a sports event or activity;
d) a gala presentation or an awards show;
e) a production that solicits funds;
f) reality television;
g) pornography;
h) advertising;
i) a production produced primarily for industrial, corporate or institutional purposes;
j) a production, other than a documentary, all or substantially all of which consists of stock footage.
## 4.02 How CAVCO assesses whether a production falls under an ineligible genre definition
At the Part A application stage, CAVCO reviews the
synopsis for the production.
If the synopsis in the application does not provide
sufficient information about a production’s genre, CAVCO
may also request other script material (for example, a
treatment, a screenplay, or an episodic breakdown) or, in
some cases, a preliminary copy of the production.
At the Part B application stage, CAVCO reviews a copy
of the production.
Note that when CAVCO is reviewing an application for a
new season of a series that has been certified in previous
seasons, the genre of the new season is still assessed.
See section 1.13 for more information on requesting a
pre-assessment related to genre eligibility.
## 4.03 Additional clarifications (including definitions) for each ineligible genre
### 4.03.01 News, current events or public affairs programming, or a program that includes weather or market reports
**Key things to know:**
1) Clarification regarding each section of the definition:

   **Element 1: A production that… presents local, regional, national or international news in the form of a newscast.**
  - This section of the definition captures traditional newscasts and clarifies that it applies to all types of newscasts, regardless of their territorial scope.
  - Included within this category are daily news, evening news and 24-hour news channel programming.
   - Examples: 6 p.m.
news, ABC World News Tonight

   **Definition:**
   A production that:
   - presents local, regional, national or international news in the form of a newscast;
  - is presented in the form of specialized news programming, including, but not limited to, business news, sports news or entertainment news;
  - presents live or pre-recorded coverage of current events;
   - presents discussions or analysis of current political or public policy issues in the form of one-on-one, round-table or panel discussions, debates, open forums or town hall meetings;
  - includes weather or market reports; or
   - includes a combination of any of the above elements.

--- PAGE 22 ---

22
   **Element 2: A production that… is presented in the form of specialized news programming, including, but not limited to, business news, sports news or entertainment news.**
  - This section of the definition covers specialized news programming dealing with a more narrow scope of news than a traditional newscast.
  - While this section identifies the most popular types of specialized news programming (business, sports and entertainment), it is not limited to those.
For example, a specialized news production focusing on the video gaming industry, or on science-related news, would be included within this section.
  - For clarity: To be included within this section, a show has to predominantly present news on a given subject matter.
This section does not include lifestyle/human interest shows that deal with a specific subject matter (e.g., fishing, golfing, video gaming) in a broader way.
  - Examples: Entertainment Tonight, ESPN SportsCentre

   **Element 3: A production that… presents live or pre-recorded coverage of current events.**
  - This section of the definition refers to coverage of events that are typically covered by reporters or news divisions of broadcasters, but that are not presented in the form of a traditional newscast.
  - This section does not include live performing arts shows.
   - Examples: Election coverage, royal weddings, parades, political conventions.
  **Element 4: A production that… presents discussions or analysis of current political or public policy issues in the form of one-on-one, round-table or panel discussions, debates, open forums or town hall meetings.**
  - This section of the definition is designed to capture “public affairs programming.”
  - This includes any production that predominantly consists of discussions of political news or government policy.
  - Such productions are typically produced through the news division of a broadcaster.
  - Examples: Meet the Press, State of the Union

   **Element 5: A production that… includes weather or market reports.**
  - Any production that includes a weather or market report, regardless of the length of that segment, will be ineligible.
For example, a talk show that includes a weather report will not be eligible.
  - Productions with fictional weather or market reports will not be deemed to fall within this section of the definition.
  - Example: The Today Show

   **Element 6: A production that… includes a combination of any of the above elements.**
  - This section of the definition clarifies that a production consisting of a mixture of any of the above elements will also fall under this genre and therefore be ineligible.
### 4.03.02 A production in respect of a game, questionnaire or contest (other than a production directed primarily at minors)
**Key things to know:**
1) The definition does not apply to productions directed primarily at minors.
2) The presence of prizes is not a consideration when deciding whether a production falls under this genre.
Whether or not a prize is awarded, or the monetary value of a prize, does not change the basic premise of a show and is not used by CAVCO as a determining factor for eligibility.
**Definition:**
A production where individuals or teams participate in a game, quiz, or contest that has an objective outcome (e.g., right/wrong, complete/incomplete, fastest time, highest score) to determine a winner, whether or not a prize is awarded.
A production that combines tasks that are measured objectively with tasks that are measured subjectively is included in this genre.
A production that includes competitive elements but features character development over the course of a series (e.g., by starting with a group of participants who are competing against each other and who are eliminated as the series progresses) is not included in this genre.

--- PAGE 23 ---

23
**Examples:**
Competition-based lifestyle/human interest programs with character development over the course of a series (which can therefore be eligible): Survivor, Amazing Race or American Idol
Productions that would be ineligible: Jeopardy, The Price is Right, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, Let’s Make a Deal, American Ninja Warrior, Fear Factor, Des chiffres et des lettres
See Figure 2 below for more information on how CAVCO evaluates whether productions fall under this genre.
**Figure 2: A production in respect of a game, questionnaire or contest (other than a production directed primarily at minors)**
**(Diagram not reproducible in Markdown, text description follows)**
**Figure 2: Notes:**
- If there is a mix of objective and subjective outcomes, then choose “YES” for the first question.
- A “subjective outcome” is one determined by a decision-maker such as a judge or the audience.
- An “objective outcome” is one that is right/wrong, complete/incomplete, fastest time, etc.
- Whether or not there is a prize does not factor into the decision.
- Prolonged set-up to a game should still be considered part of the game.
- If the winner of each episode of a series returns in the next episode until they are defeated by a new challenger, the series is still considered to have new contestants in every episode (i.e. not an elimination series), since such a series still wouldn’t have the requisite character development.


--- PAGE 24 ---

24
### 4.03.03 A sports event or activity
**Key things to know:**
1) This genre includes coverage of traditional sporting events or activities (e.g., hockey, football, tennis, the Olympics, motocross racing, darts, etc.) as well as coverage of other competitive tournaments (e.g., chess, poker, eSports or similar activities commonly known as “mind sports”).
2) This genre does not include:
   - documentaries about sports;
   - lifestyle/human interest productions focused on a sport or recreational activity (e.g., skiing, fishing, snowboarding) that are informational, instructional or educational in nature;
or
   - a regularly scheduled, stand-alone sports talk show.
**Definition:**
A production that consists of:
- live or pre-recorded coverage of a professional or amateur game, match, competition, or tournament;
and/or
- pre- and post-game shows for sports events or activities.
### 4.03.04 A gala presentation or an awards show
**Key things to know:**
1) An award includes any type of honour or recognition.
2) This genre includes all awards shows, whether or not they also contain other elements such as comedy or musical performances.
3) This genre includes related pre- or post-event coverage (e.g., the red-carpet Oscar pre-show).
4) This genre does not include behind-the-scenes or “making-of” productions about these events.
**Examples:**
Gala presentation: gala dinners, gala screenings, gala performances, Miss America pageant, Kennedy Center Honors
Awards show: The Academy Awards, The Tony Awards, La cérémonie des César, NFL Honors
**Definition:**
A production that consists of:
- live or pre-recorded coverage of a gala presentation or an awards show;
and/or
- pre- and post-event coverage of these events.
### 4.03.05 A production that solicits funds
**Key things to know:**
1) This genre includes productions that visually or verbally solicit funds for any purpose (including, but not limited to, a charity or social cause) by directing viewers to a website, phone number or address through which they can make donations.
2) Verbal requests are generally done by a representative of the show such as a host, announcer or regular panelist.
The genre does not include productions featuring incidental soliciting of funds by guests on a show.
**Examples:**
Hope for Haiti Now telethon, Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day telethon, Le téléthon de l’Association française contre les myopathies
**Definition:**
A production that includes a segment of any length aimed at soliciting funds or other contributions from viewers.
### 4.03.06 Reality television
**Key things to know:**
1) This genre refers to productions assembling pre-existing footage from public or private cameras.
**Definition:**
A production that consists of:
- scenes recorded on private or public authority surveillance equipment;
or
- the recording of any sort of official proceedings such as live or live-to-tape coverage of courtroom trials or governmental proceedings.

--- PAGE 25 ---

25
2) This genre does not refer to what viewing audiences have generally considered “reality television” since the late 1990’s, subsequent to the naming of this genre (e.g., Survivor, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, etc.).
### 4.03.07 Pornography
**Definition:**
A production that contains explicit depictions or descriptions of a sexual nature, without regard to artistic merit.
### 4.03.08 Advertising
**Key things to know:**
1) CAVCO assesses whether a production is “advertising” based on what is on-screen, using the elements set out in the definition.
CAVCO does not assess the primary intent or “true nature” of a production in determining whether it is advertising.
In CAVCO’s experience, the presence of an agreement between an advertiser or sponsor and a producer or broadcaster, including where the former provides financing to a production, does not necessarily translate into any overt on-screen promotional content in the production.
Similarly, the absence or non-disclosure of such contracts does not mean there will be no advertising on-screen.
2) For greater certainty, the following elements do not automatically make a production advertising:
   - The name of a brand is in the title of the production
   - A brand is involved in the creation of the program
   - A brand has the right to final factual review of the production
   - The production is named after a book, video game or toy
   - The viewer is directed to the production's website for more information
   - There is a link in the tail credits to a sponsor's website or to a website where products can be purchased
   - The production is broadcast with commercial breaks or other promotional
content (e.g., on a website) that is related to a brand featured in the production
   - The production is filmed at the brand's place of business
   - The production is partially or fully funded by a brand
3) The involvement of any advertiser or sponsor in a production must respect CAVCO’s producer control guidelines.
These entities cannot, for example, have final creative or editorial control over a production, and are restricted to having customary consultation and approval rights.
For more information on CAVCO’s assessment of producer control, see section 6.10.
4) Clarification regarding each section of the definition:

   **Element 1: A production… that is a commercial or infomercial.**
  - This part of the definition refers to the most traditional types of advertising – a television commercial and a longer-form infomercial.
  - A commercial may or may not include a “call to action”.
In fact, most commercials do not include a clear “buy this” message.
  **Element 2: A production… that includes a call to action soliciting the viewer to purchase a good or service (e.g., directing the viewer to a store or website other than the production’s website).**
  - This part of the definition refers to an explicit verbal or visual solicitation directed at viewers to purchase a
**Definition:**
A production:
- that is a commercial or infomercial;
- that includes a call to action soliciting the viewer to purchase a good or service (e.g., directing the viewer to a store or website other than the production’s website);
- that promotes broadcast schedules or programming; or
- where more than 15% of the running time consists of:
  - extolling the virtues of one or more products, services, events, organizations or businesses, and/or
  - logos or other brand identifiers.

product or service. Viewers may be directed to a production’s website for general information purposes.
  **Element 3: A production… that promotes broadcast schedules or programming.**
  - This part of the definition includes:
     - a television production including any on-screen visual presentation of upcoming broadcaster schedules;
and
     - a television production – whether a stand-alone production, or a special episode of a series – focusing on the promotion of broadcaster schedules or programming throughout the show.
An example of this would be a show featuring stars or personalities promoting other programming on the same network.
  **Element 4: A production where more than 15% of the running time consists of:**
     - **extolling the virtues of one or more products, services, events, organizations or businesses, and/or**
     - **logos or other brand identifiers.**
  - “Extolling the virtues” involves praising the features of the presented products or services, portraying them in an exclusively positive fashion.
  - “Extolling the virtues” can be done visually (often in conjunction with verbal messaging) by presenting lingering “glamour” shots of products or services.
  - Productions that follow the structure of a “brochure” for a product or service will typically fall within this category.
For example, if a large portion of a show dealing with a certain type of product or service is dedicated to highlighting multiple features or amenities of a specific example of that product or service, it is very likely that the production will be considered advertising, because more than 15% of the running time will consist of extolling the virtues of that product or service.
  - On-screen logos or other brand identifiers will not be counted towards the 15% threshold where they are presented in an incidental and occasional fashion in the background, and are not focused on visually (e.g., through close-ups, recurring shots, lingering shots, etc.)
5) Clarification regarding review shows:
CAVCO does not consider a bona fide review of a product or service to be “extolling the virtues” of a product or service.
To distinguish between these two situations, CAVCO will consider the following questions:
(i) Is the product or service presented in a balanced way?
(ii) Is the product or service compared to any competitors’ products, either within an episode, or over the course of a series?
(iii) Is there an evaluation of the product or service that goes beyond simply providing a list of all its features?
Affirmative answers to these questions are expected for CAVCO to consider the presentation of a product or service to be a review.
If CAVCO determines that a production is a review show, or that a segment within a production features the review of a product or service, the positive references to these products or services, as well as any shots of logos appearing during reviews, will not be counted towards the 15% total in element 4 of the definition.
If, on the other hand, CAVCO determines that the presentation is not a review, it will count towards the 15% evaluation in element 4 of the definition.
### 4.03.09 A production produced primarily for industrial, corporate or institutional purposes
**Key things to know:**
1) Productions in this genre are generally, but not necessarily, commissioned by a corporate entity for internal purposes or for promotional purposes.
They are usually informational, instructional or educational with respect to the commissioning group’s activities.
2) As there can be some overlap between this genre and the ineligible genre of “advertising,” a production may in some cases be ineligible on the basis of falling under both genres.
**Definition:**
A production primarily made to meet the specific industrial, corporate or institutional needs of a business, organization, government entity, or industrial sector.
Productions such as, but not limited to, recruitment videos, corporate training videos, public service announcements and promotional videos are included in this genre.

### 4.03.10 A production, other than a documentary, all or substantially all of which consists of stock footage
**Definition:**
A production, other than a documentary, all or substantially all of which consists of pre-existing footage.

# 5. Treaty Coproductions
## 5.01 Overview
An audiovisual coproduction is a production created by
pooling the creative, technical and financial resources of
coproducers.
Coproductions produced according to the terms of a
coproduction treaty between Canada and another country
are granted national status in each country, and are
eligible for the CPTC where they meet all other applicable
requirements under the Regulations.
The recognition of a project as a treaty coproduction must
be obtained from the designated authority in each
coproducing country.
## 5.02 Roles of Telefilm Canada and CAVCO in Coproduction Certification
**Telefilm Canada:** As the administrative authority for
coproduction treaties involving Canada, Telefilm reviews
coproduction applications to determine whether they
meet the provisions of the applicable coproduction treaty.
Telefilm provides CAVCO with a preliminary and a final
recommendation on whether or not the production meets
the terms of the relevant treaty.
The full text of all current coproduction treaties, as well as
Telefilm’s policies, guidelines and online application
portal, are available on Telefilm’s website.
**CAVCO:** CAVCO will assess the production’s compliance
with the treaty, taking into account the recommendation
made by Telefilm.
CAVCO recommends to the Minister of
Canadian Heritage to certify a coproduction as a
“Canadian film or video production” where it meets the
requirements of the treaty and all other applicable CPTC
requirements under the Act and Regulations.
The Minister is responsible for rendering the final decision
as to whether a production is a treaty coproduction that
can be certified under the CPTC program.
For clarity: a production company must submit separate
applications to both Telefilm and CAVCO to have a
production certified as a treaty coproduction pursuant to
the Act and Regulations.
## 5.03 Requirements for CPTC Certification of a Treaty Coproduction
The following requirements in the Act and Regulations do
not apply to treaty coproductions:
a) All individuals occupying the producer position must be Canadian.
b) The production must meet key creative point requirements.
c) The production must meet minimum Canadian expenditure requirements for prescribed production and post-production costs.
d) Only the Canadian production company or a prescribed person may own copyright in the production.
e) Only the Canadian production company or a prescribed person may control the initial licensing of commercial exploitation rights for the production.
f) The Canadian production company (or a related prescribed taxable Canadian corporation) must retain an acceptable share of revenues from foreign exploitation of the production.
All other CPTC requirements still apply to treaty co-productions.
## 5.04 Treaty Coproduction Attestation Process
A CPTC certificate may be used by Canadian funding
programs, broadcasters or regulatory authorities as
recognition that a production has been granted treaty
coproduction status by the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
However, there may be cases where a production is not
eligible for the CPTC, despite conforming to the
requirements of a coproduction treaty.
This may occur,
for example, where a CPTC application or certification
deadline is not met, or where the production is an
interactive digital media production that is not eligible for
the CPTC.
Upon request by the production company, CAVCO may in
these cases issue a “coproduction attestation” letter,
which provides a “CP” number for the production.
This
letter from the Director General, Audiovisual Branch on
behalf of the Minister, confirming that the project has
achieved treaty coproduction status outside of the
framework of the Act, may then be filed with funders,
broadcasters or other authorities as necessary.
Contact CAVCO for details on how to apply for a
coproduction attestation letter.

## 5.05 International Co-ventures
Co-ventures are international productions that are not
produced in accordance with an audiovisual coproduction
treaty.
Co-ventures do not qualify for the CPTC.
Additional information on co-ventures can be found in the
Guide to the CRTC Canadian Program Certification
Application Process.

# 6. Key Creative and Producer-Related Personnel
## 6.01 Requirements for Proof of Canadian Citizenship or Permanent Residency
### 6.01.01 Overview
To be eligible for CPTC certification, a production must
meet requirements related to the staffing of Canadian key
creative and producer-related personnel on the
production.
See sections 6.02-6.12 for more information
on these requirements.
An applicant must provide proof that individuals for
whom key creative points are being requested, as well as
individuals occupying producer-related positions, are
Canadian.
This is demonstrated through the applicant
providing CAVCO Personnel Numbers (also known as
CAVCO IDs) for these individuals, within their
application.<sup>13</sup>
The term "Canadian," in this context, refers to a person
who is a Canadian citizen as defined in the *Citizenship Act*,
or a permanent resident as defined in the *Immigration
and Refugee Protection Act*.
The person must be Canadian
during the entire time they perform any duties in relation
to the production.
Note that this use of the term “Canadian” is different
from the definition of “Canadian” found in the *Investment Canada Act*, used for determining whether a production
company is Canadian-controlled (see section 2.01).
### 6.01.02 Permanent residents of Canada
A permanent resident of Canada is a person who has
acquired permanent resident status pursuant to the
*Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*.
To maintain this
status, the person must meet certain minimum residency
requirements during each five-year period.
Permanent residents may apply for Canadian citizenship
once they have been ordinarily resident in Canada for at
least three of the previous five years, and have met
certain other requirements.
<sup>13</sup> Key creative personnel and producer-related personnel requirements are different in the context of treaty coproduction applications.
However, the names of all individuals occupying any of these positions (as well as their CAVCO Personnel Numbers, if they are Canadian) must
still be included in applications to CAVCO.
For information regarding key creative personnel requirements in treaty coproductions, please
consult the relevant coproduction treaty and Telefilm Canada’s coproduction guidelines on Telefilm Canada’s website.
For more information on permanent residency status or
obtaining Canadian citizenship, consult the Immigration,
Refugees and Citizenship Canada website.
### 6.01.03 CAVCO Personnel Numbers
To obtain a CAVCO Personnel Number, an individual
occupying a key creative or producer-related position
must submit an application with a document
demonstrating Canadian citizenship or permanent
residency.
More information on the application process
for CAVCO Personnel Numbers is available on CAVCO's
website.
Each individual confirmed as a Canadian citizen or
permanent resident is assigned a unique CAVCO
Personnel Number.
Production companies applying to
CAVCO for a production must obtain these numbers
directly from individuals occupying key creative or
producer-related roles.
CAVCO does not provide these
numbers to production companies.
Canadian citizens need to apply only once for a CAVCO
Personnel Number.
Permanent residents need to resubmit proof of
permanent residency status when their permanent
resident card expires.
CAVCO Personnel Numbers issued
to permanent residents have a zero as the first digit in
their numerical portion (e.g., ABCD0123).
CPTC applicants must ensure that any Canadian filling a
producer-related or key creative role in their production
has obtained a CAVCO Personnel Number.
Production
companies are encouraged to obtain the numbers at the
time of hiring any individuals occupying these positions.
If the CAVCO Personnel Number provided to a production
company identifies an individual as a permanent resident,
the production company should ensure that the individual
can demonstrate, with a valid permanent resident card,
that they have permanent resident status at the time they
are providing services to the production.
Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit CAVCO
Personnel Numbers at the time of their Part A application.
The numbers are mandatory for all Part B or Part A/B
applications.
Note that the failure of an applicant to
submit one or more CAVCO Personnel Numbers with a
Part B or Part A/B application will result in fewer points
being allotted to the production and, in some cases, in a
production being ineligible.

--- PAGE 31 ---

### 6.01.04 Acceptable proof of citizenship or permanent residency
The following documents are accepted as proof of
Canadian citizenship or permanent residency:
a) For Canadian citizens:
   - Birth certificate from a Canadian province or territory (issued under the applicable *Vital Statistics Act*)
   - Canadian Certificate of Registration of Birth Abroad (issued prior to 1977)
   - Certificate of Canadian Citizenship or Certificate of Naturalization (not commemorative issue)
   - Certificate of Indian Status
   - Registered Indian Record (must be certified)
   - Canadian Passport
b) For permanent residents:
   - Valid Permanent Resident Card (front and back)

<sup>14</sup> In the rare situation where there is no lead performer in a production, this requirement does not apply.
See section 6.07 for more information on the lead performer position.
## 6.02 Key Creative Personnel – Live Action Productions
To be a Canadian film or video production, a live action
production other than a treaty coproduction (see
Chapter 5) or a documentary (see section 6.04) must be
allotted a total of at least six points based on the table
below.
Points are allotted only if all individuals occupying
the position are Canadian.
In addition, the following requirements must be met:
a) Either the director or screenwriter position must be occupied by a Canadian.
b) At least one of the two highest paid lead performers must be Canadian.<sup>14</sup>

There are 10 possible key creative points available for a
production.
If some points are not applicable, the total
number of available points is reduced accordingly.
For
example, if a production has only one lead performer, and
this person and all others occupying key creative positions
are Canadian, the production will receive 9 out of 9
points.

**Table 1: Key creative point system for live action productions**

| Key creative position                                                              | Number of points | Additional information                                       |

## 6.03 Key Creative Personnel – Animation Productions
To be a Canadian film or video production, an animation
production must (other than if it is a treaty coproduction
– see Chapter 5) be allotted a total of at least six points
based on the table below.
A point will be allotted only if
all individuals occupying the position are Canadian or, in
the case of location-based points, where the work is
performed solely in Canada.
In addition, the following requirements must be met:
a) The director, or the principal screenwriter and storyboard supervisor, must be Canadian.
b) The lead voice receiving the highest or second highest remuneration must be Canadian.<sup>15</sup>
c) The key animation must be done in Canada.<sup>16</sup>

**Table 2: Key creative point system for animation production**

| Key creative position / Location                                   | Number of points | Additional information                                     |

<sup>15</sup> In the rare situation where there is no lead voice in a production, this requirement does not apply.
See section 6.07 for more information on the lead voice position.
<sup>16</sup> For digitally animated productions, CAVCO will generally accept a lead compositor in 3D digital animation or a layout supervisor in 2D digital animation as equivalent positions.
Requests for consideration of other individuals occupying a position equivalent to the camera operator position will be examined by CAVCO on a case-by-case basis.

## 6.04 Key Creative Point Requirements for Documentaries
For the purpose of the CPTC program, a documentary is
defined as an original work of non-fiction, primarily
designed to inform but that may also educate and
entertain, providing an in-depth critical analysis of a
specific subject or point of view.
If a documentary production does not have lead
performers or other positions such as art director or
music composer, it can still meet the key creative point
requirements even if it has not been allotted the six
points, or has not obtained one of the two points allotted
for lead performers.
However, all the filled key creative
positions must be occupied by Canadians.
For example, a
documentary production can receive 5 out of 5 points and
be eligible.

--- PAGE 33 ---

33
## 6.05 General Rules for Evaluating Key Creative Points
a) When confirming who is occupying key creative or producer-related roles on a production, CAVCO will take into account information submitted within the application, including relevant supporting documents such as lists of onscreen credits, performer agreements, budgets, and exploitation agreements.
b) Regardless of the specific position title they are given, the head individual(s) for each department will be the individual(s) evaluated when determining whether the applicable key creative point(s) for a production will be allotted.
For example, on some productions, the position of “technical director” or “lighting director” may be equivalent to that of “Director of Photography.”
As well, the head of the art department often receives the credit “Production Designer.”
c) Any individuals grouped under the same position title in a production’s credits will be presumed to be performing the same role for the production.
d) No points will be allotted for a Canadian who shares the functions of a key creative position with one or more non-Canadians.
e) Where the functions of a position are carried out by more than one Canadian, only the specified number of points for that position will be allotted.
For example, only one point would be awarded for the position of director of photography, even if the position is shared by two Canadians.
f) For a series, each episode is considered a separate production under the CPTC program.
Applicants must therefore provide the names of individuals occupying key creative positions for any and all episodes.
If key creative positions or locations vary from episode to episode, different episodes may receive different numbers of points.
In these instances, the CAVCO certificate will indicate a range of points for the series (e.g., 7 to 8 out of 10 points).
g) Where a production consists of both live action elements and animation elements, the production’s key creative points will be based on the point scale for the predominant production type.
<sup>17</sup> In everyday discussions with CAVCO, and in the CPTC application, the "lead performer with the highest remuneration" is commonly referred to as the "first lead performer", and the "lead performer with the second highest remuneration" as the "second lead performer."
In the context of the CPTC, the "first lead" and "second lead" designations relate specifically to the allotment of points according to the Regulations, and do not necessarily align with how these expressions may be used in other contexts in the industry.
## 6.06 Screenwriters
To obtain the two points for the position of screenwriter,
a live-action production must meet one of the following
conditions:
a) Every individual involved in the preparation of the screenplay for the production – in other words, everyone, including writers, showrunners, story editors and story consultants, involved in developing the screenplay, from the outline or treatment through the various drafts and dialogue polishes to the final shooting script – must be Canadian;
or
b) The principal screenwriter must be Canadian, and the screenplay for the production must be based on a work authored by a Canadian and published in Canada.
## 6.07 Lead Performers (live action) / Lead Voices (animation)
### 6.07.01 Determination of lead performers and allotment of points – Live action
At least one point must be allotted to either the lead
performer with the highest remuneration or the lead
performer with the second highest remuneration<sup>17</sup>, for a
production to qualify for CPTC certification.
It is rare for a production (other than a documentary) to
have no lead performer.
If CAVCO reviews a production
and concludes that there are no lead performers, the
requirement to have a lead performer point will not
apply.
The production must still meet the requirement of
having at least six points or, in the case of documentaries
(see section 6.07.09), having all key creative positions
occupied by Canadians.
### 6.07.02 Step 1 – Are there lead performers?
Allotting points to lead performers is a two-step process.
The first step is to determine who the lead performers
are in a production.
There may not be any lead
performers, or there could be several.
There is no ranking
of performers at this step and their citizenship is not
taken into account.
There is only a determination of
which individuals, if any, are giving lead performances.

--- PAGE 34 ---

34
As indicated in the Regulations:
*A lead performer in respect of a production is an actor or actress who has a leading role in the production having regard to remuneration, billing and time on screen.*
It is important to note that in practice these three
elements do not always run in parallel.
For example, the
performer with the highest remuneration could have the
third longest screen time and receive the second highest
billing.
While non-fiction productions may not have an "actor or
actress," this does not mean there are no performances
being given or no leading roles.
For example, hosts,
narrators, dancers, singers, specialty act performers,
featured experts, judges on a panel, and subjects in
lifestyle/human interest productions will all be
considered performers.
The determination that needs to
be made in these cases is whether they have leading
roles, and are therefore lead performers.
See section
6.07.06 for more information on lead performers in non-fiction productions.
A lead performer should be an individual (whether
performing as a character or not) who carries the story in
a fiction or non-fiction production.
A performer who has
only a minor or peripheral role will not be considered a
lead performer by CAVCO.
This will be the case even if
the character or individual in question may be considered
crucial to a pivotal plot point or is otherwise integral to
the production.
While this approach means that a Canadian will not be
allotted a key creative point for a minor role, it also
means that a non-Canadian will not be considered a lead
performer when they are in a minor role.
The elements of time on screen, remuneration and billing
are not necessarily weighed equally in making a
determination of lead performance.
See below for more
information on the factors that CAVCO considers with
respect to each element.
In considering these three elements, CAVCO examines
the claims made by the applicant with respect to which
performers are leads, while also considering performers
not claimed as lead performers, to determine if they
should in fact be considered leads.
**Time on screen** - Generally speaking, the "time on
screen" element is a very important factor in the
determination of whether a performance is a lead
performance.
While there is no set minimum time on
screen for a performer to be considered a lead
performer, it should be obvious when viewing the
production who the lead performers are, and they must
have more than a brief, incidental presence in the
production.
Remuneration and billing are expected to be
roughly in line with what is seen on screen.
CAVCO considers the total time of the performance
(whether on-screen or off-screen) in determining
whether the role should be considered a lead
performance or a minor role.
Time spent by a performer
in the background of a scene will not be counted towards
the total time.
**Remuneration** - CAVCO takes into account direct and
indirect financial compensation, as well as additional
benefits, residuals, contingent compensation, travel or
living expenses, and any similar expense incurred in
relation to an individual.
The remuneration for a
performance must not be allocated to other duties to
make it lower (e.g., by entering into a second contract
with the person for consulting or other services).
While there is no minimum threshold for remuneration
for a lead performance, and no requirement for lead
performers to be paid equally or have similar
remuneration, the relative remuneration of performers
will be used as an indicator in determining whether or
not an individual is a lead performer.
CAVCO recognizes that there are many factors that come
into play when production companies determine
remuneration for a performer, and remuneration (either
relative or absolute) will never be used in isolation to
determine whether a given performer is a lead
performer.
However, it can be looked at in combination
with the other two elements to either support or refute
the notion that a given performer is a lead performer.
**Billing** - The primary consideration for this element is
how the performers are billed in the screen credits.
For
non-fiction productions in particular, CAVCO will also
consider how the claimed lead performers are featured in
publicity for the production.
For example, if the claimed
first lead is promoted heavily in connection with the
production and the claimed second lead is only promoted
minimally or not at all, this will be used as an indicator
that the claimed second lead may not truly be a lead
performer.
The same principle applies where a claimed
first lead is not promoted at all, while other individuals
are heavily promoted as being the stars or featured
performers in the production.
While it is understood that production companies are not
always in control of all publicity surrounding a
production, experience has shown that a review of the
publicity for a non-fiction production often supports
preliminary conclusions based on an evaluation of the
time on screen element.
Information found in publicity
will never be used on its own to conclude that an
individual is, or is not, a lead performer.

### 6.07.03 Step 2 – Who are the lead performers with the highest and second highest remuneration?
Once the lead performers in a production have been
established, their respective remunerations are used to
rank them in order of highest to lowest paid.
One point is
then allotted if a Canadian is receiving the highest
remuneration, and one point is allotted if a Canadian is
receiving the second highest remuneration.
At this step,
the time on screen and billing are no longer considered;
only remuneration is relevant.
In cases where a Canadian and a non-Canadian lead
performer are remunerated equally, the non-Canadian
lead performer will be ranked above the Canadian.
For example, if the total remuneration for Canadian lead
performer A is $50,000, and the remuneration for
Canadian lead performer B and non-Canadian lead
performer C is $40,000 each, a point will go to Canadian
A as the highest paid, but no point will be allotted for the
second highest paid, since the position will be deemed to
be occupied by the non-Canadian.
Canadian lead
performer B will be ranked third.
As another example, if there are three lead performers all
being remunerated equally at $50,000 each but two of
them are non-Canadian and one is Canadian, the two
non-Canadians will be ranked first and second in
remuneration, with the Canadian third.
Therefore, no
lead performer points will be allotted and the production
will be ineligible.
### 6.07.04 Determination of lead performer/lead voice and allotment of point – Animation
For animation productions, there is only one point
available for the lead voice.
It is allotted if the lead voice
that was paid either the highest or second highest
remuneration is Canadian.
The point must be given for
the production to qualify.
In the rare situation where there is no lead voice in an
animated production, there is no requirement to have
the lead voice point.
The production must still have at
least six points.
As with live action productions, allotting a point to a lead
voice (who can be performing one or multiple characters)
is a two-step process.
The first step of determining who the lead voices are is
the same as the determination of lead performances for
live action productions, except that “billing” is not one of
the considerations.
As indicated in the Regulations:
*A lead voice in respect of an animation production is the voice of the individual who has a leading role in the production having regard to the length of time that the individual's voice is heard in the production and the individual's remuneration.*
The allotment of the point is based on the remuneration
of the lead voice(s), as with Step 2 for live action
